In order to look foward, we must evaluate the past and present to determine the future.

## The Past

Growing up, I was addicted to video games in a terrible manner. I would constantly consume my free times playing Xbox 360 games like Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, etc.. In a way, it created a terrible habits of starving myself, as well as becoming slightly anti-social. Playing video games was all I needed in life since it fueled my excitement like gasoline fueling fire. The more I games I play, the bigger my excitement becomes. Thinking back, I didn't think I enjoyed playing video game, but I enjoyed controlling things, like a functioning a controller to do this on the TV. I believe that at this point, it was the start of my Software Enginnering interest.

## The Present

Currently, I am a UH Manoa student pursueing a degree in Computer Science. Naturally, I would take a Software Engineering course as it is a requirement to graduate. I do not play games as much as I was in the past, if anything, I completely stopped playing video games and started becoming a young, confident extrovert. I have actual hobbies that require me to interact with people and the benefits this would benefit me to be more social. Which directly helps me communicate with people and that's a requirement to becoming a Software Engineer. I'm gaining skills that help me contribute as a team member.

## The Future

In the long road, all I want is to do is successfully being stable. Meaning, having a job, maintaining myself physical and emotionally, and able to live like a normal adult. After this course, I hope that I gain skills that would help me become a Software Engineer. If I decided to pursue a different path, I would still benefit from this course as it requires teamwork, which is only beneficial no matter what field I go to.
