For this project, my parents wanted to display our new Mother Mary statue that they bought from Vietnam. Known for being a mother, they thought it would be best to build a pond, and represent her as a provider for Koi fish. This entire project was very hard working and very different from my other projects as it requires constant tweaking and plan changes. Right now, my dad considers it to be "unfinished" since it's missing proper water filtration and treatment. In my opinion, I think the pond looks great as is, and doesn't need more tweaking. Other than adding a water filtration. 

During the construction of this pond, my role was to dig a whole and find rocks for decoration. Digging the whole took my brothers and I about 10 hours in total, over the course of 3 days. The main problem during this process was to find a place to put the dirt, so we carried it into a deep corner of the backyard. Another problem was equipment. There were only two shovels the entire process and we had to carry the dirt, using Home Depot buckets that took tons of trip to dispose the dirt. Finally, finding the rocks. We traveled into the country side of Oahu, searching for huge stones to make our pond look as natural as possible. 

For this project, I learned that hard work pays in the end. Even though this project was labor-intensive, I was very satasfied with the current outcome. Halfway through the projects, I wanted to give up so many time as there was constant changes that was needed to be made. However, I sucked it up, and was glad that I held it to the end.
